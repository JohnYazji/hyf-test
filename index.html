<a href="https://placeholder.com"><img id="about-pic" src="https://scontent-arn2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15078725_10211511746326710_7579225988503786860_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&_nc_oc=AQk0iKMH_vZWfatHcy-tO4xXobPZa6LcDIIi2TUgxoHg60o5XL-URfuykqDj--8qrEQ&_nc_ht=scontent-arn2-1.xx&oh=82fa1c74a07b90ea32e3d29f2fc8d31b&oe=5E02FA0D" alt="About" /></a> I graduated from the faculty of education (The psychological counseling department) from Damascus University in 2007. And I have a postgraduate diploma in education “leadership management and change” in 2013, from Middlesex University, Dubai, UAE.
I would like to learn and become a professional in this field because I have the ambition to learn computer languages and creating websites for a long time, as well as to learn how to build mobile APPs.
  I am very interested in the web-development and I would love to learn how to build full-stack applications as well as HTML, CSS, Command Line, Git, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and MySQL. I was always thinking that coding is very difficult to learn and man needs a long time to be good at it. Especially, when I was going through the “view page source” and “inspect” on the web pages and seeing thousands of scripts there. But when I have been introduced to your program by one of my friends and I have watched some videos about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I recognized that is things can be done by time and with some special efforts.
